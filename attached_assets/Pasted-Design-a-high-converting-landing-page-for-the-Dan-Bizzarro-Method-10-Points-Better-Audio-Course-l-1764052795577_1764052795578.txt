Design a high‑converting landing page for the Dan Bizzarro Method: “10 Points Better” Audio Course launching with Ride IQ in early 2026. The page should persuade amateur eventing riders (Starter, Beginner Novice & Novice levels) to purchase or pre‑order the course. Use long‑form, benefit‑driven copy and proven conversion elements similar to the Insta Profit System page, while aligning with the Ride IQ brand (elegant equestrian aesthetic with trustworthiness).

1. Hero Section

Craft a bold headline that clearly states the transformation, e.g., “Become 10 Points Better in Your Next Dressage Test” or “Ride Smarter & Sharper with Dan Bizzarro’s Proven Method.” Emphasise the benefit (“10 points better”) and hint at the outcome (smarter, sharper dressage).

Write a concise subheading explaining that this is an 8‑lesson audio course (6 mounted ride‑alongs + 2 unmounted lectures) designed for Starter–Novice eventing riders to master geometry, transitions, straightness and show preparation
notion.so
.

Include a striking hero image or video of Dan coaching a rider or a dressage arena. The hero section should also feature a prominent CTA button (“Pre‑order Now,” “Join the Waitlist,” or “Get Early Access”) in a contrasting colour.

2. Introduce Dan Bizzarro & Build Credibility

Summarise Dan’s story briefly: Italian international event rider who began riding at nine, moved from Italy to England to learn under Olympic medalist William Fox‑Pitt, and now shares his knowledge through his app and Ride IQ
equiteam.co.uk
. Highlight that he is passionate about helping riders of all levels
equiteam.co.uk
.

Add a small photo of Dan and maybe a quote about why he created the course.

3. Identify Rider Pain Points

List common struggles faced by amateur dressage/eventing riders: difficulty maintaining straightness and accuracy, inconsistent circles and corners, unclear understanding of what judges want, nerves before a test, and lack of structured warm‑up routines.

Emphasise that without guidance, riders often lose easy points and feel stuck (similar to how the Insta Profit page calls out pain points)

.

4. Present the “10 Points Better” System

Introduce the course as a step‑by‑step audio program with eight core lessons (briefly summarise each lesson’s transformation and benefits):

Ride the Lines Like a Pro: master straight lines, corners and diagonals; ensure the horse is straight and responsive
notion.so
.

The 20 m Circle, Nailed: use precision markers to ride perfect geometry, develop bend from the inside leg and maintain rhythm
notion.so
.

The Magic of the 20 m Square: Dan’s go‑to exercise for suppleness and corner strength; improves rider alignment
notion.so
.

Transitions Done Right: spiral and leg‑yielding techniques to sharpen responsiveness and balance
notion.so
.

The Walk, Your Most Underrated Gait: fix common walk issues, encourage stretch into the contact and help tense horses relax
notion.so
.

Test Riding 101 (Unmounted): break down each movement, read the test as a rider vs. what the test says, and prepare strategically
notion.so
.

Reading the Test Like a Judge (Unmounted): interpret movements from a judge’s perspective, learn what earns points and what penalises
notion.so
.

Pre‑Test Warm‑Up Routine: follow Dan’s ride‑along warm‑up for bend, balance and relaxation; includes mindset cues
notion.so
.

Clarify that the course includes downloadable diagrams (20 m circle with cone placement, 20 m square turning zones) and a rider checklist
notion.so
.

Mention that the program delivers lifetime access via Ride IQ
notion.so
.

5. Show the Value & Bonuses

Consider a limited‑time launch price or early‑bird discount to create urgency. If including bonuses (e.g., exclusive webinar with Dan, additional checklist, or discount on future Ride IQ membership), present them in a value stack similar to the Insta Profit page: list each bonus with a crossed‑out value and “Free” label.

Reinforce that riders get a step‑by‑step system, ride‑along audio, and ready‑to‑print diagrams—making it a complete package.

6. Testimonials / Social Proof

If available, include quotes or feedback from riders who have worked with Dan or tested the course. Alternatively, use short testimonials about Dan’s coaching or his app.

Display photos (with permission) or star ratings to build trust.

7. FAQs & Objection Handling

Add a FAQ section addressing:

“Who is this course for?” (Starter–Novice riders; no advanced experience needed).

“Do I need to ride at a specific venue?” (No; arena references are generalised
notion.so
).

“When is it available?” (Early 2026; lifetime access via Ride IQ).

“How long are the lessons?” (Audio ride‑along length per lesson).

“What equipment do I need?” (Any standard arena; the diagrams help with setup).

“What if I’m not satisfied?” (Offer a clear refund/guarantee policy).

8. Guarantee & Risk Reduction

Include a risk‑free guarantee (e.g., 30‑day satisfaction guarantee) to reduce perceived risk, similar to the Insta Profit System’s refund policy

.

9. Call‑to‑Action Sections

Repeat the CTA after major sections with text that reflects the visitor’s mindset. For example, after detailing the benefits, say “Start Getting 10 Points Better Today” with a button linking to the order form.

Use contrasting colours and generous white space so the CTA stands out

10. Design & UX Notes

Follow an F‑pattern or Z‑pattern layout for easy scanning, with section headings, short paragraphs and bullet points
crazyegg.com
.

Use high‑quality photos or illustrations of riders performing circles, squares and transitions. Include icons or small diagrams near lesson descriptions to visualise the content.

Maintain Ride IQ’s branding (fonts, colours). Keep the overall tone professional yet friendly and encouraging.

Craft this landing page in persuasive, empathetic language. Focus on the rider’s transformation and the convenience of audio‑ride‑along lessons. Emphasise Dan’s credibility and the unique structure of the course, and make it effortless for visitors to take the next step.
