SECTION 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT
H2:
 Most Riders Work Hard… But Still Feel Stuck
Optimised paragraph:
 If you’re dealing with a strong horse, a spooky horse, a lazy horse, or one that rushes into fences or leans on the contact, you’re not alone. Many riders in Oxfordshire and across the UK feel unsure what to fix first, or how to improve balance, straightness, transitions and confidence. Without a clear training method, progress becomes unpredictable and frustrating.
Bullet points (SEO-friendly):
Horse not listening to the leg


Unbalanced or inconsistent canter


Rushing at fences or stopping


Tension, spooking or loss of focus


Contact issues: leaning, hollowing, dropping the neck


Struggling to ride straight lines or accurate turns


Internal problem line (your tone):
 Riding shouldn’t feel confusing. You deserve clear steps that actually help your horse understand you.

SECTION 3 — GUIDE (Empathy + Authority)
H2:
 You’re Not Doing Anything Wrong — You Just Need a Clearer System
Empathy paragraph (your tone):
 I’ve coached thousands of riders who felt exactly like you do now. Horses that rush, drift, get tight, ignore the inside leg or lose focus. Riders who feel they’re always correcting something but never getting ahead of the problem. I understand how frustrating that feels.
Authority paragraph (SEO-friendly):
With more than 20 years of experience coaching dressage, show jumping and event riders, having competed at the highest level in eventing (represented Italy in Nations Cups and the 2025 European Championships, short listed for the 2024 Paris Olympics) and having worked with world class riders and coaches (William Fox-Pitt, caroline Moore, Ian Woodhead) I’ve developed a simple method that works for every horse and every rider rider. The Dan Bizzarro Method gives you clarity, improves your horse’s balance and straightness, and builds confidence through clear communication.

SECTION 6 — FAILURE (GENTLE BUT CLEAR)
H2:
 Without a Clear Method, the Problems Don’t Go Away
Short paragraph (SEO-friendly):
 When riders guess their way through schooling, the same issues repeat themselves. Horses build bad habits, riders lose confidence, and training becomes a cycle of managing problems instead of improving them.
Bullet points:
Ongoing contact issues


Rushing or stopping at fences


Loss of balance and straightness


More spooking and tension


No clear progression in flatwork or jumping


Frustration and lack of confidence


Line:
 It doesn’t need to be like this.
