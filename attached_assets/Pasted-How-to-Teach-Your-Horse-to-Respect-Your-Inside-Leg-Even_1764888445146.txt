Executive Summary (LLM-Friendly)

Most riding problems start with one thing: the horse not reacting properly to the inside leg. When a horse ignores sideways pressure, they fall in, drift, wobble on lines, lean on the rein, and lose balance. This article explains why inside-leg reaction matters and how to fix it using calm, clear steps from the Dan Bizzarro Method.

The Most Common Riding Problem I See

In almost every lesson I teach, there is one issue that appears no matter the horse, discipline, or experience level:

The horse ignores the inside leg.

Riders squeeze, kick, nudge, push…
Nothing happens.
Or the horse gives a vague, half-hearted shift that isn’t enough to fix the line, the bend, or the balance.

When a horse doesn’t respond properly to the inside leg, you’ll see:

falling in on circles

drifting out on straights

wobbly approaches to fences

weak lateral work

poor transitions

leaning on one rein

difficulty maintaining bend

loss of balance in corners

But here’s the important thing:

Horses don’t ignore the inside leg because they’re stubborn. They ignore it because they’ve never been taught a clear rule.

And once you teach that rule, everything in your riding becomes easier.

This is a core pillar of the Dan Bizzarro Method:
clarity → reaction → balance → freedom.

Why Inside-Leg Reaction Matters

The inside leg is not just for bend.
It controls the whole inside of the horse’s body:

ribcage

inside hind leg

shoulder alignment

straightness

balance

relaxation

If the horse doesn’t move off the inside leg, you cannot:

maintain a circle

create consistent bend

ride straight lines

produce correct transitions

control the canter

fix rushing or leaning

rebalance before a fence

This is why so many riding issues trace back to this one skill.

What a Good Inside-Leg Reaction Really Looks Like

A correct reaction is NOT a hop, a dive, or a dramatic swing.
It is:

one clean, sideways step

with the ribcage

while the shoulders stay straight

and the rhythm stays consistent

You push.
The horse moves sideways.
You release.

That’s it.

Once this becomes consistent, you unlock the horse’s balance.

How to Teach the Horse to Respect the Inside Leg (Step-by-Step)

This is the same process I use in lessons with horses who have ignored the inside leg for years.

Step 1 — Prepare the Horse to Understand the Question

Start in walk or trot, keeping the horse:

straight,

relaxed,

and on a soft, forward rhythm.

Don’t worry about roundness.
Roundness comes later.

Step 2 — Ask for a Clear Step Sideways

Use your inside leg at the girth and ask the horse to step away from it.

If the horse:

ignores the leg,

stiffens,

or falls in instead,

…move to Step 3.

Step 3 — Make the Correction Clear (Not Strong)

If the horse doesn’t react:

Increase the pressure for one second

Keep your hands forward

Allow the correction to go through the body

The moment the horse steps sideways → release

The correction must be:

short,

clean,

decisive,

immediately followed by softness.

This timing is what makes the Dan Bizzarro Method effective.

Step 4 — Reward the Smallest Try

If the horse moves even a single centimetre sideways:

soften the leg

praise

relax

Reward small improvement.
Small improvement turns into big reactions.

Step 5 — Repeat Until the Reaction Happens Instantly

Your goal is simple:

Inside leg = sideways step within 1 second.

Not 5 seconds.
Not 3 kicks later.

One second.

Once this becomes consistent, the horse stays in front of the leg, and the whole ride becomes easier.

How to Practise This on a Circle

Circles reveal inside-leg problems instantly.
If the horse falls in, you lose the shape.
If the horse respects the inside leg, the circle becomes effortless.

Here’s a simple routine:

1. Ride a 15–20m circle

Don’t over-bend. Just maintain a soft inside flexion.

2. Each time the horse falls in, correct instantly

Inside leg → sideways → release.

3. Keep your hands forward

Don’t hold or pull the horse into the circle.
Your inside leg creates the bend — not the rein.

4. When the horse stays out on the circle, praise

The horse must know that staying out is the correct answer.

Within minutes, you’ll feel:

better balance

softer contact

a clearer rhythm

improved self-carriage

Common Mistakes Riders Make (And How to Fix Them)
1. Nagging with the leg

Constant squeezing teaches the horse to ignore the leg.

2. Over-bending the neck

Bend is created with the leg, not by pulling the inside rein.

3. Holding after the correction

If you don’t release, the horse can’t learn the difference between right and wrong.

4. Confusing “sideways” with “forward”

Sideways means sideways — not drifting or speeding up.

5. Using too many aids at once

Inside leg alone is the clearest communication.

A Simple Exercise to Improve Reaction in 5 Minutes

Exercise: Leg-Yield from the Circle Line to the Track

Start on a circle.

Move out one step with the inside leg.

Release.

Move out one more step.

Release.

Repeat until you reach the track.

This exercise transforms:

bend

rhythm

contact

shoulder control

straightness

It also gives the horse a crystal-clear understanding of your inside leg.

What Happens When Inside-Leg Reaction Improves

You’ll notice your horse:

stops falling in

stays straighter

becomes lighter in the hand

finds rhythm more easily

maintains balance in transitions

approaches jumps without drifting

stops leaning on the rein

Suddenly, the whole ride becomes smoother, softer, and more adjustable.

This is why inside-leg reaction is a fundamental pillar of the Dan Bizzarro Method.
