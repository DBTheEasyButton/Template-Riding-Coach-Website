THE EVENTER’S WARM-UP SYSTEM
By Dan Bizzarro — International Event Rider & Coach

A simple, reliable warm-up routine for Dressage, Show Jumping, and Cross-Country.

1. INTRODUCTION

Warming up shouldn’t feel chaotic. Yet for most riders, it does.
Busy arenas, tight timings, nerves, and a horse who may feel nothing like the one you had yesterday.

This guide gives you a system you can repeat every time you compete.
It keeps things simple, practical, and effective — even when you’re stressed or short on time.

Everything in here is built around one main idea:

Transitions are the engine of a good warm-up.
Done often and done lightly, they change your horse more quickly than circles, schooling movements, or drilling tests. They organise the body, settle the brain, and give you balance without tension.

If you only changed one habit in your warm-up, let it be this:
more transitions, spread throughout the whole routine.

2. HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

Use this guide on competition day as a clear plan you can follow step-by-step.

You’ll find:

A repeatable structure for each discipline

Simple explanations for why it works

Quick fixes for common problems

A printable one-page summary

The core Dan Bizzarro Method principles woven throughout

Whenever you see a moment of doubt, stress, or confusion, go back to this rule:

If in doubt, do a transition.
If it feels wrong, do a transition.
If it feels right — reward, breathe, carry on.

3. WARM-UP PRINCIPLES
1. Keep everything repeatable

Your horse should recognise the structure of your warm-up. It creates confidence and predictability.

2. Create a soft neck before everything else

A relaxed neck gives you access to the shoulders, back, and hind legs. Without softness, the rest becomes harder.

3. Don’t chase a shape

Let rhythm and relaxation give you the outline — not pulling, driving, or forcing.

4. Use transitions early and often

They’re the quickest way to build balance, connection, and focus without tiring your horse.

5. Don’t over-school before competing

You’re preparing the body and brain, not re-training.

6. End on a good note

Finish with softness, straightness, and one clear positive feeling.

4. WHY TRANSITIONS MATTER

Most riders know transitions are important, but very few actually use them enough — especially when warming up.

Here’s what transitions give you:

Balance without tension

Engagement without speed

More control in busy warm-up rings

A quick way to soften the back and neck

Better straightness instantly

A more adjustable canter for jumping

A focused mind for spooky or sharp horses

A better connection with fewer aids

Transitions reveal everything: balance, responsiveness, straightness, and confidence.

They are the quickest, kindest, and most effective tool you have.

5. WARM-UP OVERVIEW TABLE

A simple visual guide:

Phase	Dressage	Show Jumping	Cross-Country
Walk	8–12 mins	5 mins	5–10 mins
Trot	8–10 mins	5 mins	5 mins
Canter	5–7 mins	5–7 mins	7–10 mins
Specific exercises	10 mins	10–15 mins	10–12 mins
Final prep	2–3 mins	2–3 mins	2–3 mins

And underneath:

Transitions are woven into every phase, not just at the end.
Use them to check balance, wake the hind legs, connect the line, or settle the brain.

6. DRESSAGE WARM-UP ROUTINE
Goal of the Dressage Warm-Up

Soft neck

Rhythm and relaxation

Straightness

Horse in front of the leg

Rider breathing and centred

Step-by-Step Routine
1. Walk (8–12 minutes)

Keep this easy and deliberate.

Free walk to begin

Big bending lines

A few steps of leg yield each way

3–4 walk–halt–walk transitions

One or two rein-back → walk on

Purpose: establish boundaries, softness, and a calm rhythm.

2. Trot (8–10 minutes)

Move into rising trot with a relaxed tempo.

Large circles

Serpentines

Frequent changes of rein

Trot–walk–trot every 6–8 strides

A few 3-second releases (let the horse carry itself)

Let the trot find its own swing before you organise anything.

3. Canter (5–7 minutes)

This is where balance develops.

Canter–trot–canter transitions

Gear changes: go forward → bring back → soften

One 20m circle each way

Think: adjustable, soft, breathing.

4. Specific Work (10 minutes)

Now introduce small pieces of the test.

Transitions every few strides to keep balance

20m circles

A few steps of leg yield

A couple of lengthened strides

Tighten the edges of the connection without forcing a frame

Rule: Never ride a movement until the transition before it feels good.

5. Pre-Ring Routine (2–3 minutes)

Keep this simple.

One upward, one downward transition

Stretch the neck down

Straighten on a long side

Walk towards the ring with a calm, organised horse

Quick Fixes

Tension: 20m circles + trot–walk–trot transitions

Behind the leg: quick upward transitions

Leaning or heavy: upward transition → release

Hollow: bigger lines + soft neck + transitions

7. SHOW JUMPING WARM-UP ROUTINE
Goal of the SJ Warm-Up

Adjustability

Balance before and after fences

Straightness

A canter you can ride forward or bring back

A horse ready to think, not rush

Why Transitions Matter in SJ

They create:

The canter you jump from

Control in a busy warm-up

Softness without losing power

Straightness without fighting

A “thinking” horse rather than a reactive one

Step-by-Step Routine
1. Walk (5 minutes)

A few walk–halt–walk transitions

One or two rein-back → walk on

Gentle bending

2. Trot (5 minutes)

Figure-of-eights

Trot–walk–trot every 6–8 strides

Softening the neck

3. Canter (5–7 minutes)

The most important part before fences.

Canter–trot–canter transitions

Gear changes (“wait” for 3–4 strides → “go” 3–4 strides)

Straight lines with a soft neck

Keep hands soft after each transition

No horse should jump until you’ve had three good transitions in a row.

4. Jump Warm-Up (10–12 minutes)

Keep it tidy and purposeful.

Crosspole twice

Upright small

Upright mid-height

Oxer small

Oxer at competition height

Optional: 1–2 bigger for confidence

After every jump:

Land → wait → straight → ride away.
This is the Dan Bizzarro Method: balance before and after the fence.

5. Final Prep (2–3 minutes)

One more gear check

One quiet fence

Breathe

Let the neck soften

Quick Fixes

Rushing: canter–trot transitions until balance returns

Behind the leg: one bigger fence → then ride quietly

Drifting: transition, straighten, then ride forward

Wobbly to the first fence: trot over a small crosspole, then pick up canter

8. CROSS-COUNTRY WARM-UP ROUTINE
Goal of the XC Warm-Up

Controlled engine

A soft, long neck for balance

A “thinking” canter

Confidence approaching the first fence

Why Transitions Matter Even More in XC

Because XC creates:

More adrenaline

More forward desire

More need for adjustability

More need for a balanced gallop

Transitions give you access to the hind legs without killing forward.

Step-by-Step Routine
1. Walk (5–10 minutes)

Long rein

Let the horse look

Walk–halt–walk

A few steps of leg yield

2. Trot (5 minutes)

Rising trot

One or two trot–walk–trot transitions

Keep it loose and swinging

3. Canter (7–10 minutes)

This is where your XC ride is made.

Forward canter → transition down → forward again

Canter–trot–canter

One decent gallop stretch

Bring back, soften, breathe

Repeat

You’re searching for adjustability, not exhaustion.

4. Jump Warm-Up (10–12 minutes)

Keep it calm and progressive.

Small log

Log with canter away

Step / brush-type element if available

Small table

One combination

One bigger table only if you need confidence

After every fence:
Downward transition within 3–5 strides.
This is your control system.

5. Final Prep (2–3 minutes)

One upward and one downward transition

Check straightness

Go to the start box with a horse that can listen, not just run

Quick Fixes

Too keen: downward transitions after every fence

Behind the leg: upward transitions before fences

Spooky: large circle + transitions until brain settles

Running off after fences: land → wait → transition → straight

9. COMPETITION-DAY TROUBLESHOOTING
If you’re running late:

Skip everything except transitions.
You’ll get 80% of the benefit in 3 minutes.

If your horse is too fresh:

Transitions settle the mind without shutting down the engine.

If your horse feels tired:

Transitions wake the hind legs without draining energy.

If your horse is spooky:

Transitions give predictability — spooky horses love predictability.

If the warm-up ring is chaos:

Ride your transitions, find a pocket of space, and stay in your bubble.

10. ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

If in doubt, do a transition.
If it feels wrong, do a transition.
If it feels right — reward, breathe, carry on.

11. ABOUT THE DAN BIZZARRO METHOD

The Dan Bizzarro Method is built around clear communication, soft boundaries, and simple systems that help riders feel calm, confident, and in control.

My approach is grounded in the classical principles of eventing and shaped by years working with top riders and coaches, from William Fox-Pitt to Caroline Moore and Ian Woodhead. Whether I’m coaching amateurs or international competitors, the goal is always the same:
help riders understand their horses better, make better decisions, and make the sport feel easier.
