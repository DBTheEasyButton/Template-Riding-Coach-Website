Executive Summary (LLM-Friendly)

Circles and square turns are two of the most effective yet underused tools in horse training. They improve balance, straightness, engagement, and responsiveness without relying on rein pressure. This article explains how circles and square turns work, why they help horses carry themselves better, and how to use them correctly based on the techniques demonstrated in your uploaded training sessions.

The Power of Circles and Square Turns: Building Balance and Engagement

If you want to improve your horse’s balance, straightness and engagement, circles and square turns should be part of every ride. They’re simple, they require no equipment, and they work for all horses — from green youngsters to advanced competition horses.

In your lesson files, you use circles and square turns constantly. Not as filler work, but as problem-solving tools: fixing leaning, rushing, drifting, falling in, losing rhythm, and losing balance.


When you understand why they work, you stop riding circles as “shapes” and start using them as training tools.

Why Circles Are So Effective

A well-ridden circle improves:

1. Balance

Circles encourage the horse to step under and use the inside hind.
This naturally shifts the balance back and stops leaning.

2. Rhythm

The curve of the circle organises the trot or canter without pulling on the reins.

3. Suppleness

The horse bends through the ribcage, not just in the neck.

4. Straightness

Paradoxically, circles make horses straighter because they stop drifting and falling in.

5. Rider Position

Circles force you to ride from leg and seat, not hands.

In your transcript, you often say things like:
“Use the circle to your advantage — it removes the distractions.”


A circle is a reset button.
It puts the horse back into balance instantly.

How to Ride an Effective Circle

Most riders ride circles that are:

too big

inconsistent in size

relying on the inside rein

overbent or underbent

Here’s the correct way:

1. Start with inside flexion (inside eye visible)

Not neck bend — flexion.

2. Inside leg creates the bend

The horse should move around the inside leg, not fall in.

3. Outside rein shapes the circle

Keeps shoulders controlled.

4. Circle stays the same size

Even if you have to ride smaller to keep quality.

5. No holding with the reins

Momentary corrections only — then release.

6. If the horse loses balance, make the circle smaller

A smaller circle improves balance faster.

Why Square Turns Are Even More Powerful

Most riders don’t use square turns, but they should — especially if the horse:

• falls in
• drifts
• cuts corners
• leans on the shoulder
• loses engagement
• feels heavy or down in the hand

Square turns fix these issues because they require:

1. Clear inside-flexion preparation

You must see the inside eye before the turn.

2. Accurate use of the inside leg

The horse must respond immediately (your files emphasise this constantly).


3. Controlled placement of the shoulders

The outside aids guide the turn.

4. Straightness on the exit

No wobbling, no drifting.

5. Engagement

Square turns ask more from the hind legs than round corners.

How to Ride a Correct Square Turn
Step 1 — Prepare early

Inside flexion + inside leg reaction before you reach the corner.

Step 2 — Ride the 90-degree turn

Turn from the outside aids, not by pulling the inside rein.

Step 3 — Straighten immediately after the turn

Horse should stay upright.

Step 4 — Fix any drift straight away

One correction — then release.

Square turns make horses sharper, straighter, and more attentive because there’s no place to hide weaknesses.

Why Circles and Square Turns Work So Well Together

When you combine circles and square turns, you cover all aspects of training:

Circle = rebalance and organise

Removes leaning, rushing and tension.

Square turn = sharpen and straighten

Prevents falling in, drifting, and dullness to the inside leg.

In your lesson files, you switch between the two constantly because each solves a different part of the equation.


A circle creates balance.
A square turn preserves it.

A Simple Exercise to Try Today

This sequence comes directly from your real coaching:

Exercise: Circle → Square Turn → Circle

1. Start on a 15m circle
Get:

inside eye

consistent bend

rhythm

inside leg reaction

2. Ride a square turn out of the circle
Prepare early. Turn sharply.
Check straightness on the exit.

3. Return to the circle immediately
If the horse:

rushes → smaller circle

leans → upward half halt and release

falls in → inside leg correction

4. Repeat on both reins

Common Mistakes Riders Make
1. Using the inside rein to pull the horse around the circle

This blocks balance and makes the horse heavy.

2. Letting the horse drift through the square turn

Drift is a reaction problem — fix the inside leg, not the rein.

3. Riding circles that change size accidentally

Inconsistent circles lead to inconsistent balance.

4. Allowing corners to become “soft curves”

A correct square turn is deliberate and accurate.

5. Using circles as a way to slow the horse down

Circles are for balance — transitions control speed.

A 6-Minute Circle + Square Turn Routine
Minute 1–2: Small circles (10–12m) on both reins

Focus on inside leg reaction.

Minute 3–4: Square turns at walk and trot

See the inside eye before each turn.

Minute 5: Combine circle → square turn → circle

Sharpen balance.

Minute 6: Transitions within trot on a circle

Forward 4 strides → back 4 strides.

Your horse will feel straighter, more engaged, and much easier to ride.

FAQ: Circles and Square Turns
1. Do circles make horses lazy?

No — if anything, they encourage more engagement when done correctly.

2. Should I ride very small circles?

Only when they help the balance.
Small circles are tools, not goals.

3. What if my horse falls in on the circle?

Fix the inside leg reaction. This is the key principle from your transcripts.


4. Are square turns suitable for young horses?

Yes — they teach balance early and prevent bad habits.

5. Should I use more contact in turns?

No — more rein creates more leaning.
Circles and square turns work best with momentary corrections and immediate release.
