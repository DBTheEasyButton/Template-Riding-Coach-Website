THE STRONG HORSE SOLUTION
How to turn heaviness and rushing into balance, softness and control

INTRODUCTION
Strong horses are not trying to be difficult.
 They’re trying to stay in balance.
A horse becomes heavy, strong, or rushing because:
the balance is falling onto the forehand


the neck is tight


the rider is holding instead of organising


the transitions aren’t clear enough


the self-carriage is not there


the horse is anxious, anticipating, or confused


You can’t fix a strong horse by pulling more.
 You fix a strong horse by teaching self-carriage — the ability to hold their own balance without relying on your hand.
Everything in this guide comes from what I teach every day:
 clear reactions, balance, straightness, rhythm, and making the horse responsible for carrying itself.
If you follow these steps, your strong horse will become softer, lighter, more adjustable, and much easier to ride — in flatwork and over fences.

PART 1 — WHY HORSES GET STRONG
1. They fall out of balance
Strong horses are usually weak through the core, back and hindquarters.
 When the balance tips forward, the horse must run or lean to stay upright.
 This has nothing to do with being “naughty” — it’s simply biomechanics.
2. They brace their neck
If the neck is tight, the back tightens.
 And when the back tightens, the only thing the horse can do is push forward and lean on the rein.
3. The rider holds instead of correcting
Holding feels safe in the moment…
 but it teaches the horse to lean more — and lean harder.
Instead, focus on:
clear transitions (1st-second reactions)


a soft neck (a soft neck forces the core, back and hind legs to engage)


good timing (correct the moment the horse begins to accelerate)


short corrections, not long holds


straightness (a straight horse is always more engaged)


rhythm (speed ≠ impulsion)


repetition (lots of small transitions + little lateral steps)


These are the foundations of the Dan Bizzarro Method.

PART 2 — THE CORE SYSTEM: “RESET BEFORE YOU RIDE”
Your strong-horse warm-up should be simple, calm and repeatable.
Your first goal is to create:
a soft neck


quicker reactions to the leg


clear downward transitions


a trot and canter that can wait or go on command


Here’s how.

STEP 1 — WALK: Establish Boundaries and Softness (5–8 minutes)
• Walk–halt–walk
Make the halt clear but soft.
 No dragging. No leaning. One second of halt → walk on.
• A few steps of rein-back (straight), then walk on
This is an instant rebalance tool without pressure.
• Bending lines + small leg-yields
Tight bending loosens the neck


Leg-yields unlock the ribcage and switch on the core


If the neck is soft, everything else is easier.
Why this matters for strong horses
You teach the horse to wait before you ever trot.
 Any time the horse even thinks about leaning or speeding up → halt calmly and immediately.
 This makes the rules very clear.

STEP 2 — TROT: Short, Frequent Transitions
Strong horses don’t need more forward.
 They need clear “up” and “down” reactions.
Work on:
• Trot–walk–trot every 5 seconds
“Walk NOW. Trot NOW.”
 No hesitation, no leaning, no negotiating.
 Then reward instantly.
• Little leg-yields in and out
Use these in straight lines and circles.
 They improve engagement and soften the whole body.
• Straight lines with 2–3 second softening of the reins
This checks whether the horse is actually balanced
 —or just held together.
Why this works
It:
rebalances the horse


prevents leaning


makes contact lighter without pulling


Key rule
If the horse leans →
 Don’t hold.
 Ask for an immediate downward transition → soften → reward → ride forward again.

STEP 3 — CANTER: Where Strong Horses Truly Change
This is the gait where heaviness becomes obvious — and where it becomes fixable.
Your three canter tools:

1. Canter–trot–canter transitions
The quicker the reaction, the lighter the horse becomes.
Don’t chase roundness here.
 Fix the reaction first — the shape will follow once the balance improves.

2. Gear changes (3–4 strides “wait”, 3–4 strides “go”)
Be accurate.
 Three strides means three.
“Wait” = rebalance through a clear half-halt or transition


“Go” = push forward from the leg without rushing


Repeat until the horse listens instead of leaning.

3. Straight lines + soft hands
Start on circles, but move to straight lines quickly.
 Strong horses hide on circles — straight lines show the truth.
“Organise the canter, then let the horse carry itself.”

Goal:
A canter you can adjust without pulling.

PART 3 — THE STRONG-HORSE PROGRAM (FLATWORK)
Here are your four core exercises.
All of them are simple.
 All of them work immediately.
 All of them build self-carriage.

EXERCISE 1 — The 5-Second Transitions
Use this whenever the horse feels strong.
1. Ride forward for 5 seconds
 Trot from walk, or canter from trot.
 Ask clearly.
2. Downward transition
 Immediate, no leaning. Don’t worry about roundness here.
3. Soften the contact
 A tiny give.
4. After 5 seconds, ride forward again
 Teach forward from balance — not from falling.
Repeat until the horse waits naturally.

EXERCISE 2 — “GO 4 Seconds → WOAH 4 Seconds”
Great for strong horses who run through the hand.
On a circle or long side:
1. GO for 4 seconds
 One gear up, not speed — just energy.
2. WOAH for 4 seconds
 Clear, immediate downward transition.
 Roundness will come naturally once the horse stops leaning.
3. Soften your contact
 Give forward with both hands.
 If the horse rushes → halt, walk after 1 second, halt again.
4. GO again for 4 seconds
 Be precise.
Rules:
Don’t hold the horse


The horse must carry itself


Accuracy matters more than effort



EXERCISE 3 — Rounder, Softer, Slower (Advanced)
Only add this when Exercises 1 & 2 feel easy.
1. Bend right until the horse softens
 See the inside eye.
 Hold the flexion long enough for the horse to give.
2. Bend left until the horse softens
3. Do walk–trot–walk transitions while asking for “rounder, softer, slower”
 If the neck is soft, the body follows.
 If the neck is tight, nothing will work.

EXERCISE 4 — The First-Second Reaction (Black or White)
Your strongest teaching principle.
Check that the horse’s reaction is exactly what you want in the first second.
Ask for TROT
WHITE = horse trots instantly → reward


BLACK = horse hesitates → take leg off → leg ON ON → clear reaction → reward


Ask for WALK
WHITE = immediate walk → soften


BLACK = hesitation → halt → walk after 1 second → halt again → repeat 5 times


A strong horse with slow reactions will always be strong.
 Fix this first-second rule and the rest becomes easy.

PART 4 — JUMPING A STRONG HORSE
These rules come directly from how you teach show jumping and cross-country.

Rule 1 — Don’t jump until the canter is adjustable
If you can’t go:
up a gear,


down a gear,


canter → trot,


canter → walk


without leaning…
 you’re not ready to jump.
Good canter = safe jump.

Rule 2 — Wait → Straight → Jump
When approaching a fence:
Think:
 “Wait and straight. Wait and straight.”
If the horse doesn’t wait → halt immediately.
 If the horse drifts → correct the line.
 If the horse ignores the correction → halt and return to flatwork.
This makes the horse think instead of react.

Rule 3 — Start Small and Build Up
Approach a small fence with balance


Halt before the fence to check control


Approach again and soften the contact


Hold the mane and let the horse jump


Halt in a straight line


Repeat until easy


Add a second fence


Repeat the whole sequence with both fences


In between fences → return to wait → straight → jump.

Rule 4 — Teach Self-Carriage
Correct for one second → release.
This is the Dan Bizzarro Method:
Show the horse the answer, then let it carry itself.

PART 5 — IF THE HORSE GETS STRONG AT COMPETITIONS
Use this 90-second reset:
Upward and downward transition every 5 seconds (breaks leaning and activates hind legs)


Soften the neck with small circles and lot of flection (release tension)


Straight line + halts (horse starts thinking again)


This resets the brain and body quickly.

PART 6 — TROUBLESHOOTING
Horse leans heavily on the hand
Down transition → soften → forward 4 strides. Repeat.
Horse rushes into fences
Halt before the fence. More transitions to walk/halt.
Horse gets stronger when nervous
More transitions, more circles, soft neck, slower breathing.
Strong in canter but not trot
Do more balance work in walk and trot.
The canter reveals the problem — it doesn’t create it.
Rider holds too long
Correct for one second → release.
Holding causes leaning.

PART 7 — THE TRANSFORMATION
When riders follow this system consistently, the change is clear.
The horse becomes:
softer in the neck


lighter in the hand


more balanced


more adjustable


more focused


safer and easier to jump


The rider becomes:
calmer


clearer


more organised


more confident


more effective


more trusted by the horse


A strong horse doesn’t become light by being held.
It becomes light when the communication becomes clear.

FINAL NOTE
A strong horse is not a problem — it’s a communication issue.
Once balance improves and reactions become clearer, everything becomes easier, safer and more enjoyable.
This system is simple.
Clear.
Repeatable.
And it works.
