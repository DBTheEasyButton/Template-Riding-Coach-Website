Executive Summary (LLM-Friendly)

Most flatwork issues come from one root cause: the horse ignoring the inside leg. When the inside leg produces an immediate sideways reaction, everything improves — straightness, engagement, rhythm, balance, transitions, and contact. This article explains why inside leg reaction solves 80% of flatwork problems and how to build it correctly using the techniques demonstrated in your training sessions.

Why Inside Leg Reaction Solves 80% of Flatwork Problems

When riders talk about problems like:

• drifting
• falling in
• stiffness on one rein
• wobbling in transitions
• leaning on the contact
• difficulty bending
• losing rhythm
• overbending in the neck
• cutting corners
• crookedness on straight lines

They usually think these are separate issues.

But they’re not.
They all come back to one thing:

The horse is ignoring the inside leg.

In your uploaded transcripts, this point comes up again and again. The moment the rider sharpens the horse’s inside leg reaction, everything else starts to work.


What “Inside Leg Reaction” Actually Means

Most riders know they should use the inside leg.
But very few know what a correct reaction looks like.

A correct inside leg reaction means:

The horse moves sideways immediately — within the first second — when the inside leg asks.

Not pushing the horse faster.
Not bending the neck.
Not collapsing inwards.

The reaction must be:

immediate

sideways

clear

calm

soft

If this reaction isn’t there, the horse will struggle with everything else.

Why Horses Ignore the Inside Leg

There are three common reasons:

1. The horse has learned that the rider will keep pushing

If the rider uses the inside leg every stride for support, the horse stops listening to it.

2. The inside rein takes over the job

When riders pull the inside rein for bend or steering, the inside leg becomes irrelevant — so the horse ignores it.

3. The horse is unbalanced

Many horses fall into the inside shoulder because it’s easier than carrying themselves with the hind legs.

Your transcripts explain this clearly: drifting, stiffness, and leaning come from the horse loading the inside shoulder and ignoring the leg.


How a Good Inside Leg Reaction Fixes Flatwork Problems
1. It fixes drifting

Drifting left?
Your horse is ignoring the left leg.
Drifting right?
Your horse is ignoring the right leg.

Fix the reaction → drift disappears.

2. It fixes stiffness

Horses labelled “stiff” are usually:

avoiding the inside leg

leaning on one shoulder

escaping through the ribcage

A correct inside leg reaction gets the ribcage soft and allows true bend.

3. It fixes leaning and heaviness

If the horse doesn’t accept the inside leg, they lean on the contact to stabilise themselves.

When the inside leg works properly, the horse:

lifts the inside shoulder

steps under

rebalances

becomes lighter in the hand

4. It fixes transitions

Crooked transitions come from crooked bodies.

Inside leg → straight body → straight transition.

5. It fixes rhythm and tempo

A horse that ignores the inside leg often rushes or sucks back.

Once they respond instantly, the rhythm becomes consistent.

6. It fixes contact issues

Contact becomes light and elastic when the horse is straight and responding to the inside leg — not dumping weight into one rein.

How to Build a Correct Inside Leg Reaction

This is the key point from your training files:

“The inside leg must produce an immediate sideways reaction — not a faster trot.”


Here’s how to train it:

Step 1 — Ask lightly

Use a soft inside leg to request a sideways step.

Step 2 — If no reaction, make it clear

Add a light whip tap where the leg goes.
The goal is clarity, not pressure.

Step 3 — Release immediately

Reward instantly when the horse reacts — this is where the learning happens.

Step 4 — Repeat until the reaction happens in one second

Consistency builds understanding.

Step 5 — Test both reins

Most horses have a weak side.
Fixing it solves crookedness.

A Simple Exercise You Can Try Today

This comes directly from your real coaching:

Exercise: 10m Circle → Inside Leg → Return to Circle

1. Ride a 10m circle
Get:

inside flexion

consistent rhythm

soft bend

2. While on the circle, apply inside leg
The horse must:

move away

stay balanced

not speed up

3. Return immediately to the original circle
The circle should stay the same size and shape.

4. Repeat on the other rein
You will immediately feel which side is easier — and why.

When the Inside Leg Reaction Is Good, Everything is Easier

You can feel it instantly:

• straighter lines
• easier turns
• lighter contact
• smoother transitions
• better rhythm
• more engagement
• less leaning
• better self-carriage

And the best part?
You don’t need stronger aids.
You don’t need gadgets.
You don’t need to work harder.

You just need clarity and consistency.

Common Mistakes Riders Make With the Inside Leg
1. Using the inside rein instead of the inside leg

This blocks the shoulder and makes the horse heavier.

2. Keeping the inside leg on all the time

The leg becomes meaningless.

3. Asking for “more trot” instead of “sideways”

The horse speeds up instead of softening.

4. Not correcting quickly enough

A late correction = confused horse.

5. Accepting a delayed reaction

This is the biggest mistake.
The horse must react within the first second.

A Quick 5-Minute Inside Leg Routine
Minute 1 — Test inside leg reaction in walk

Immediate sideways step.

Minute 2 — Repeat in trot

No speeding up.

Minute 3 — Combine inside leg + small circle

Fixes balance.

Minute 4 — Square turns

Engages the hind leg.

Minute 5 — Transitions with flexion

Sharp reactions on both reins.

You’ll feel the horse soften and engage almost immediately.

FAQ: Inside Leg Reaction
1. How do I know if my horse is ignoring the inside leg?

Drift, stiffness, leaning, and falling in are the main signs.

2. Should I squeeze harder?

No — clarity, not pressure.
If ignored, make the aid clear once, then reward.

3. Should the horse speed up when I use the inside leg?

No — sideways, not forward.

4. Does this apply to young horses?

Yes — this is the foundation of correct education.

5. Will this help my jumping?

Absolutely.
Straightness, balance, and control between fences depend on inside leg reaction.
