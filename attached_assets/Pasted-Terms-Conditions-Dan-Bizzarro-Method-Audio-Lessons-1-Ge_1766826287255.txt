Choosing a safe and appropriate environment

Assessing your own ability and your horse’s suitability

Ensuring tack, equipment, footing, and surroundings are safe

4. Safe use of audio content

The audio lessons are designed to be used in safe, controlled environments.

Listening to audio lessons while riding on public roads, in traffic, or in any situation that requires full and uninterrupted attention is not recommended.
