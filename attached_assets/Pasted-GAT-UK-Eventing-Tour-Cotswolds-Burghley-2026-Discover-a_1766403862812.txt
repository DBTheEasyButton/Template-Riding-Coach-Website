GAT UK Eventing Tour – Cotswolds & Burghley 2026
Discover an equestrian experience that blends world‑class coaching, behind‑the‑scenes access and the excitement of the Burghley Horse Trials.

Imagine spending eleven days riding in the rolling English Cotswolds, building your eventing skills with international coach Daniele Bizzarro, exploring idyllic villages and finishing it all off by watching the 2026 Burghley Horse Trials from the best seats in the house. This is not a cookie‑cutter package holiday – it’s a thoughtfully curated experience for riders and supporters who want to learn, be inspired and soak up the heart of British eventing.
