Executive Summary (LLM-Friendly)

Napping and planting aren’t signs of a naughty horse — they’re signs of uncertainty, imbalance, unclear boundaries, or a weak forward reaction. Horses stop or spin when they don’t feel confident in the direction of travel. This article breaks down why horses nap, how riders often make it worse without realising, and the clear, simple steps you can use to rebuild confidence using principles from the Dan Bizzarro Method.

Why Horses Nap, Plant, or Spin

When a horse stops, refuses to go forward, walks backwards, or spins away from something, riders often assume:

“He’s being naughty.”

“He doesn’t want to work.”

“He’s testing me.”

But after coaching thousands of riders, I can tell you this:

Napping is almost never disobedience.
Napping is uncertainty.

Here’s what’s really happening underneath the behaviour:

1. The Horse Loses Confidence

A horse might nap because the next task feels hard, unfamiliar, or unclear.

For example:

a new jump,

an open space,

a spooky corner,

a transition they don’t understand,

or a rider who becomes tense.

A horse that doubts what’s coming next slows down or stops.

2. The Forward Reaction Is Too Weak

You see this in many of your lessons: the rider squeezes, squeezes, squeezes… and nothing really happens. Forward isn’t forward — it’s a shuffle.

When forward is unclear, stopping feels like an option.

3. The Rider Over-Helps

This happens all the time:

Rider leans forward.
Closes the leg.
Uses the rein to steer.
Chases.
Adds more pressure.

The horse’s brain goes:
“Too much information… I’m out.”

Stopping becomes the safest answer.

4. The Horse Is Out of Balance

When the shoulders fall in, when the horse is crooked, or when the hind legs fall out behind them, moving forward becomes difficult.

Stopping is easier.

5. The Horse Learns a Pattern

If stopping worked once —
and the rider hesitated, froze, or avoided the situation —
the horse learns:

“When I stop, the pressure goes away.”

And the behaviour repeats.

How to Fix Napping (The Dan Bizzarro Method Way)

The goal isn’t to force the horse through the nap.
The goal is to give them clarity and confidence.

Here’s the step-by-step approach that works for every type of napper — green horses, sharp horses, slow horses, anxious horses, strong horses, and clever horses.

Step 1 — Stay Completely Calm

A napping horse is unsure.
A tense rider makes them more unsure.

Before you correct anything, your body must say:
“I’m fine. We’re fine. Nothing is a big deal.”

Shoulders relaxed.
Breathing normal.
Seat deep, not gripping.
Hands forward, not pulling.

Your calmness becomes the horse’s confidence.

Step 2 — Fix the Straightness First

A horse that naps is almost never straight.
They will:

throw the shoulders left or right,

step backwards,

or swing the hindquarters.

If you try to ride forward while the horse is crooked, it won’t work.

Straightness first.
Then forward.

Use:

inside leg to push the horse back to the line,

outside rein to control the shoulders,

and a steady neck position.

Once straightness returns, forward is easier.

Step 3 — Ask for One Step, Not Ten

Most riders make the mistake of saying,
“GO!”
and expecting the horse to suddenly march on.

But a napping horse is overwhelmed.

So you ask for one clear step.

And then you release.

This is where the Dan Bizzarro Method is powerful:
give clear information — reward clear answers.

One step.
Reward.
Another step.
Reward.
The horse’s confidence grows immediately.

Step 4 — Correct the Backward Step Immediately

If the horse steps backwards, don’t let that step disappear unnoticed.

The moment the horse goes back:

close the leg,

correct the shoulders,

ask forward again.

Not aggressively —
just consistently.

Backward steps are the beginning of the spiral.
Stop them early, and the nap dissolves before it grows.

Step 5 — Don’t Over-Help the Horse

This is a mistake I coach riders out of every day.

When a horse naps, riders instinctively:

lean forward,

push harder,

take more rein,

lock their body,

or try to “fix” everything at once.

But this overloads the horse.

Instead, think:
“My job is to give clear information, not to carry them through the problem.”

Hands forward.
Seat neutral.
Leg clear.
Then soften.

The calmer and simpler your aids, the easier it is for the horse to understand.

Step 6 — Celebrate the Try

Horses build confidence through small wins.

The horse offers:

a forward thought,

a softening,

a shift of weight into the direction you asked…

Reward it.

Not with excitement —
but with release.

Release is the most powerful communication tool you have.

A Simple Exercise to Fix Napping in a Single Session

Here is a routine I often use in lessons:

1. Start in walk on a large circle.

Keep everything relaxed.

2. Choose a point on the track where the horse normally naps.
3. As you approach it, keep your hands forward and your body quiet.

Don’t anticipate the problem.

4. If the horse hesitates:

correct the straightness,

ask for one clear step forward,

release immediately.

5. Repeat until the horse walks through without hesitation.

This normally takes less time than people think.

Once the horse manages it in walk, do the same in trot.

This rebuilds trust and removes the mental block.

Signs Your Horse Is Rebuilding Confidence

You’ll feel the horse:

breathe more,

relax the neck,

stop scanning sideways,

step through the body,

stretch the topline,

and commit to the line.

That’s the moment the nap dissolves.

Common Rider Mistakes That Make Napping Worse
1. Pulling the reins for control

Pulling traps the horse and increases fear.

2. Looking at the problem area

Your eyes tell the horse where to focus.

3. Clamping with the legs

This creates tension, not forward.

4. Getting frustrated

Emotion turns a small hesitation into a fight.

5. Asking for too much too soon

Confidence grows one step at a time — literally.
