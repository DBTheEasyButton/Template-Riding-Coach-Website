SECTION 1 — THE PROBLEM (RIDER IS THE HERO)
Headline:

If your horse feels strong, heavy or rushing… you’re not alone.

Short paragraph:

Many riders deal with horses who lean, pull, run through the hand, get quick before or after jumps, or feel strong the moment they get tense.
This isn’t because you’re doing something wrong — it’s because your horse is struggling to find balance and understand what’s expected.

Common frustrations (bullet list):

A horse that gets stronger the more you try to slow them

Leaning on the reins or becoming “heavy” in your hand

Rushing into or after fences

Ignoring half-halts or not reacting to transitions

Feeling out of control in the canter

Struggling to keep rhythm and straightness

You’re the hero in this story.
Your horse just needs a clearer system — and that’s what this guide gives you.

SECTION 2 — WHAT THE GUIDE TEACHES (THE PLAN)
Headline:

A proven, step-by-step method to create balance, softness and control

Short paragraph:

This guide shows you exactly how I take a strong, heavy horse and turn it into a soft, adjustable, easy-to-ride partner. It comes directly from the Dan Bizzarro Method and from the work I do every day with riders who face the same challenges you do.

A 90-second reset to use at competitions

Troubleshooting for real riding problems

Simple language.
Instant results.

SECTION 3 — WHY THIS WORKS (YOU = GUIDE)
Headline:

A method built for everyday riders — not just professionals

Short paragraph:

I’ve coached thousands of riders dealing with strong, heavy and rushing horses. The solution is never more force, more pulling, or stronger bits.
The solution is clarity, balance, rhythm and better reactions — the pillars of the Dan Bizzarro Method.

Authority paragraph (calm, not braggy):

As an international event rider and coach, I’ve spent more than 20 years helping riders develop horses who are softer, lighter and more confident. This guide gives you the same simple tools I use in my lessons every day.

You don’t need to be braver.
You don’t need to fight harder.
You just need a clearer system — and your horse will thank you for it.

SECTION 4 — WHAT RIDERS WILL FEEL AFTER USING IT (SUCCESS)
Headline:

Imagine riding a horse who stays soft, balanced and adjustable

Rider transformation:

You feel calmer and more in control

You know exactly what to do when the horse gets strong

You spend less time fighting and more time actually riding

Your aids feel clearer and more effective

Your confidence improves because the horse becomes predictable

Horse transformation:

Softer neck

Lighter contact

Better balance

More responsiveness

More adjustability

Less rushing, leaning and pulling

This is the difference between surviving a ride… and enjoying it.

SECTION 6 — FAQ (optional)
“Does this work for mares/geldings/young horses?”

Yes. Strong behaviour is a balance problem, not a personality problem. The exercises work for all horses.

“Do I need to be an experienced rider to use this guide?”

No. Everything is written in simple steps. If you can ride walk, trot and canter, you can use the system.

“Does this replace having lessons?”

No — but it will make every lesson easier, clearer and more productive.
