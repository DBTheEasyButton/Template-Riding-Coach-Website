From Strong to Light and Soft in 28 Days is a structured, ride-along audio course designed to help you develop a lighter, softer, more self-carrying horse through better balance, clearer aids, and progressive training.
You listen to each lesson while you ride, so the work happens in real time — with your own horse, in your normal routine.

A clear sequence that builds real change
This course is made up of six audio lessons, designed to be followed in order.
Each lesson builds on the previous one.
 The sequence matters.
That’s because lightness doesn’t come from a single exercise — it comes from developing the right foundations, in the right order:
balance before softness


understanding before adjustment


self-carriage before refinement


While the lessons can be repeated and revisited as needed, following the sequence ensures you don’t skip the steps that actually make the difference.

What the course focuses on
Most strong horses aren’t difficult — they’re trying to balance themselves the only way they know how.
In this course, you’ll learn how to:
Reduce heaviness without losing energy


Stop the horse leaning on the hand


Improve balance through correct transitions


Create softness during the work, not only afterwards


Ride with less effort and more clarity


The emphasis is on how the horse carries himself, not on managing the symptoms.
This reflects the principles of the Dan Bizzarro Method: helping horses move better by improving posture, balance, and understanding — rather than forcing outcomes.

How and where to use the lessons
The lessons are primarily flatwork-based


One lesson includes a bonus jumping element


Many of the exercises can also be applied while hacking


You don’t need a perfect arena or ideal conditions.
 The ideas are designed to be adaptable, so you can apply them in your normal riding environment.

How the course works
6 audio lessons you listen to while riding


Clear guidance you can apply immediately


Each lesson gives you:


a focus for the ride


specific exercises


what you should feel changing


common mistakes to avoid


The course is designed to be followed over 28 days, but you can move at a pace that suits you and your horse.

Who this course is for
This course is for riders who:
Feel like their horse is strong, heavy, or resistant


Want softness without losing impulsion


Feel they’re constantly managing rather than riding


Want structure and clarity between lessons or clinics


Ride for enjoyment, training, or personal goals — whatever the discipline


It’s particularly useful if you don’t have regular access to coaching but still want guidance that makes sense and produces real change.

What this course is not
This is not:
A quick fix


A gadget-based solution


A “pull less and hope” approach


It’s a methodical process that teaches you why things feel the way they do — and how to change them step by step.

The goal after 28 days
By the end of the course, you should notice:
A lighter, more consistent contact


A more balanced horse


Less effort in your arms and body


Clearer, calmer transitions


A better understanding of how to maintain softness


Not perfection — but meaningful, repeatable progress you can build on.
