## System Architecture
The platform is built with React.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. It features a multi-page architecture for improved SEO and user experience.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Clean, professional layout with a focus on readability and accessibility.
- Mobile-optimized UI for all interactive tools and content.
- Consistent branding with a blue logo and light grey navigation.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Site-wide accessibility improvements including proper heading hierarchy (no level skips), descriptive alt attributes for all meaningful images, semantic HTML structure, and WCAG 2.1 compliance for screen reader users and assistive technology.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, Wouter for client-side routing, React Hook Form with Zod for form validation, TanStack Query for data fetching and state management.
- **Backend:** Express.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **SEO:** Centralized SEO architecture with dynamic meta tag management and structured data. All canonical URLs point to danbizzarromethod.com (not replit.app domain). **Architecture Components:** (1) **SEO Config Registry** (`client/src/data/seoConfig.ts`) - Centralized metadata for public-facing pages with unique titles, descriptions, keywords, canonical paths, H1 tags, and schema configs; accessed via `getSEOConfig(route)` function. (2) **Schema Helpers** (`client/src/utils/schemaHelpers.ts`) - Utilities for generating Service, Breadcrumb, FAQ, and WebPage structured data schemas; includes `createServiceSchema()`, `createBreadcrumbSchema()`, `createFAQSchema()`, and `getBreadcrumbsFromPath()`. (3) **SEOHead Component** (`client/src/components/SEOHead.tsx`) - Dynamic meta tag injection via React useEffect; accepts title, description, keywords, canonical, and schemas array; manages Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and image preloading. **Usage Pattern:** Public-facing pages use `getSEOConfig(route)` to retrieve metadata and schema helper functions to generate structured data arrays passed to SEOHead. **Current Coverage:** 16 public pages including Home (/, uses Organization/Website/LocalBusiness schemas), 7 coaching pages (/coaching/* - Private Lessons, Clinics, Remote Coaching, Dressage, Show Jumping, Cross Country, Polework; use Service + Breadcrumb schemas), 5 main pages (/about, /contact, /gallery, /news, /podcast; use Breadcrumb schema), and 3 tool pages (/readiness-quiz, /stride-calculator, /packing-list-generator; use Breadcrumb schema). **Not Yet Migrated:** NewsArticle, TermsAndConditions, Loyalty, Admin pages, and Unsubscribe pages still use hardcoded SEOHead metadata. **NAP Schema:** LocalBusiness structured data with complete Name, Address, Phone formatting (business name: Dan Bizzarro Method, phone: +447767291713, email: dan@danbizzarromethod.com, address: Crown Farm, Ascott-Under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire OX7, United Kingdom, geo coordinates: 51.8656, -1.5653) for local business SEO; includes opening hours, service area, payment methods, and founder information. **NAP Consistency:** Complete NAP information displayed consistently across Footer, Contact page, and all user-facing surfaces to strengthen local SEO signals and Google Business Profile trust. **Canonical Tag Management:** All migrated pages have self-referential canonical URLs (each page points to itself) for independent ranking. SEOHead component dynamically manages canonicals client-side via React useEffect. **Adding New Pages:** When creating new public-facing pages, extend `seoConfig.ts` with route-specific metadata and use `getSEOConfig(route)` in the page component to ensure SEO coverage. Admin/utility pages may use direct SEOHead calls with hardcoded metadata.
- **Core Web Vitals Optimization:** Modern image formats and lazy loading strategies for improved performance. HeroPicture component serves WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks using `<picture>` element. All coaching page hero images use loading="eager" with fetchPriority="high" (priority={true}) for LCP optimization. Subsequent carousel/gallery images use loading="lazy". Fully implemented on all coaching pages: Home, Private Lessons, Clinics, Remote Coaching, Show Jumping, Cross Country, Dressage, and Polework. About Dan page also uses HeroPicture for optimized hero image. WebP format provides ~25-40% file size reduction over JPEG/PNG. All hero images now consistently optimized for Core Web Vitals.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Coaching Section:** Renamed from "Services" to "Coaching" with updated URL structure (`/coaching/*`). Includes dedicated pages for Private Lessons, Clinics (formerly Group Clinics), Remote Coaching, Dressage, Show Jumping, Cross Country, and Polework, all optimized for SEO and dual audience appeal. All coaching pages feature "Book a Lesson" WhatsApp buttons in hero sections. Flexible clinic management allows per-session and total clinic max participants with transaction-based capacity enforcement. **Privacy-focused design:** session max participant numbers are hidden from public view; only admins see capacity details. Public users see "FULL" or "spots left" warnings without revealing exact capacity numbers. **Clinic Registration Form:** Removed "Experience Level" field (clients select sessions by skill level instead); "Horse Name" is now mandatory for all clinic registrations and syncs to GHL as a custom field; "Special Requests" field placeholder guides users to include preferred session times and specific goals for better clinic organization. **Auto-Fill for Returning Clients:** Email-based lookup automatically pre-fills registration data (name, phone, horse name, emergency contact, medical info) for clients with previous registrations, improving user experience and reducing friction. API endpoint `/api/clinics/lookup-by-email/:email` retrieves most recent registration by email. **GDPR Compliance:** Terms & Conditions section includes comprehensive data privacy notice explaining data storage, usage for clinic management and auto-fill, commitment not to share with third parties, and client rights to view/update/delete data. **Google Maps Integration:** Admin clinic form includes optional Google Maps link field for clinic locations; when provided, clinic location links use the custom Google Maps URL instead of search-based location links. **Call-to-Action Buttons:** Below "Earn Rewards with Every Clinic!" section, replaced "Clinic Terms & Conditions" button with "Book a Virtual Lesson" WhatsApp button (phone: +447767291713).
